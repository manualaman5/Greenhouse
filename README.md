Hi everyone!

In order to have a own-hosted Alexa skill, you will need to set up the front end [here](https://developer.amazon.com/es-ES/alexa "Alexa developer"). The back end is going to be hosted in AWS Lambda.

Make sure that you have:

* Correct intents in your front end.
* The front end and the back end are connected using ARN AWS.
* Configured your account in the AWS CLI.
* Updated the Scripts/Update_function.sh so it updates your Lambda function.

Now, you just have to use:
**bash run.sh**

Thanks! :thumbsup:
